## Quick Start — Minimal Sim2Sim

**1. Install**

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**2. Download assets**

```bash
pip install modelscope
python scripts/setup/download_assets.py --only gmr ckpt bvh
```

**3. Run**

```bash
python scripts/run/run_sim.py \
    controller.policy_path=track.onnx \
    input.bvh_file=data/sample_bvh/aiming1_subject1.bvh
```

You should see a MuJoCo viewer with the robot tracking the BVH motion.

To show the simulated D435i RGB camera view, add the explicit `camera` viewer:

```bash
python scripts/run/run_sim.py \
    controller.policy_path=track.onnx \
    input.bvh_file=data/sample_bvh/aiming1_subject1.bvh \
    'viewers=[sim2sim,camera]'
```

For sim2real, viewers are disabled by default. Add `viewers=retarget` to show
the retargeted reference in an optional MuJoCo window.

## Pico Motion Recording

Record many Pico clips as training-ready G1 motion NPZ files:

```bash
pip install -e '.[pico4]'
python scripts/run/record_pico_motion.py
```

The recorder starts the Pico receiver and live Retarget viewer before waiting
for clip names, so preview keeps running while the terminal is idle. Enter a
semantic clip name, then use `R` to start, `S` to save, `D` to discard, `N` for
a new name, and `Q` to quit. Saved clips are written to
`data/pico_motion/clips/` using the semantic label in the filename, with no
sidecar JSON.

Merge recorded clips into the standard shard dataset:

```bash
python train_mimic/scripts/data/build_dataset.py \
    --spec data/pico_motion/pico_recorded.yaml --force
```

## Changelog

### Unreleased

- Bumped Pico input support to pico-bridge 0.2.1 and its corrected tracking pose semantics.
- Added optional LinkerHand L6 sim2real modes under `hands.*`: `gripper` from Pico grip/trigger and `vr_hand_pose` from Pico hand pose through somehand 0.2.0 public API.
- Set LinkerHand L6 `vr_hand_pose` control to maximum speed while keeping `gripper` at the configured default speed.
- Switched default `vr_hand_pose` to a low-latency somehand path with 60 Hz hand retargeting and reduced smoothing.
- Realtime mode switches and pause/resume now preserve GMR IK warm-starts instead of cold-starting the retargeter on each transition.
- Added an interactive Pico motion recorder that saves retargeted G1 motion clips as training-ready NPZ files.
- General-Tracking-G1 training now defaults to uniform motion sampling; clip-local adaptive sampling remains available through `sampling_mode=adaptive`.
- Added optional `sampling_mode=rewind` for training, which restarts failed episodes from the same clip after rewinding a configurable number of policy steps.
- Added root velocity, joint tracking, and survival rewards to the General-Tracking-G1 training objective.

### v0.3.0 (2026-05-12)

- Consolidated realtime input around pico-bridge 0.2.0 and removed the old ZMQ/onboard Pico path.
- Unified sim/sim2real reference buffering, resume realignment, and velocity smoothing.
- Added UDP BVH realtime input, online sim config, multi-viewer support, and fixed camera viewing.
- Split sim2real reference/safety runtime modules and updated the G1 MuJoCo camera asset.

### v0.2.0 (2026-04-03)

- Added Pico 4 teleoperation through pico-bridge and the G1 Bridge SDK.
- Added offline playback keyboard controls, Pico sim2sim mode control, and a standalone standing controller.
- Improved realtime mocap buffering/catch-up and upgraded the released model to the 30k checkpoint.

### v0.1.1 (2025-03-28)

- Dataset shard-only refactor and `adaptive_bin` sampling
- External asset management (ModelScope), repository slimming

### v0.1.0 (2025-03-25)

- Initial public release: General-Tracking-G1 training, ONNX sim2sim inference, Pico 4 VR teleoperation, Unitree G1 hardware deployment
